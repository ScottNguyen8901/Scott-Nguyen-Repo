% An axisymmetric spacecraft has principal moments of inertia (50, 50, 70) kg m2.  
% At t=0, the spacecraft is rotating with angular velocity components (1,1,10) rad/s.   
% What is the value of the constant c1 in the solution to the linear differential equation for w1?
% Give your answer in rad/s, with four digits to the right of the decimal place.

% Given parameters

% Constants
