    "1. Consider a ground sensor at 35°N latitude & 108°W longitude. Let us define the sensor’s “field of regard” as the entire area that the sensor can “see” above the horizon from its location on the Earth. This can be visualized by drawing a plane tangent to the Earth at the point where the sensor is located (see illustration below).\n",
